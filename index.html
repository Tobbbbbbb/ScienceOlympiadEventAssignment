    <h1>Science Olympiad Team Creator</h1>
    <p>In order to use this program, five data files are needed.</p>
    <h3>Form Output File</h3>
    <p>
      The first data file should be the form output from the Science Olympiad Event Selection form.
      This should be a copy of the form from last year, where the only changed fields are the previous classes, current classes, and events.
      An example form can be found below.
      While this form does ask for everyone to rank their top 17 events, if a team can be made considering only their first N event choices, the program will do so.
    </p>

    </a>
    <h3>Class Data File</h3>
    <p>
      The second data file should be a csv containing info about each class offered or previously offered at LFA.
      The first column should be the class name, as shown in the Science Olympiad form.
      The second column should be the weight of the class (1 for regular/advanced classes and 2 for AP or PAP classes).
      The third column should list what subjects are related to the class among Phys (physics), Chem, Bio, and Env (environmental).
      If there are multiple subjects, make sure to put quotations around them and separate them using a comma and a space.
      All subjects should be capitalized.
    </p>
    <h3>Event Data File</h3>
    <p>
      The third data file should be a csv containing info about the events.
      The first column should be the event name, as it appears in the Science Olympiad form.
      The second column should be the number of people in each event.
      The third column should be the letter of the block the event happens (i.e. put A for A block).
      If it's a self-schedule event, use X as the block.
      The fourth column should list what subjects are related to the event among Phys (physics), Chem, Bio, Env (environmental), and Any, if the event does not directly correlate to a specific science (things like WIDI and Codebusters fall in this category).
      If there are multiple subjects, make sure to put quotations around them and separate them using a comma and a space.
      All subjects should be capitalized.
    </p>
    <h3>Extracurricular Data File</h3>
    <p>
      The fourth data file should be a csv containing the names of any extracurriculars offered.
      If there is a comma in any of the names, stop the names right before the comma.
    </p>
    <h3>Varsity Data File</h3>
    <p>
      The fifth data file should be a csv containing the emails of the varsity members.
      This does not have to be a definitive list, but it's used to get a good prediction of the varsity team for next year, based on who has been reliable in previous years.
      You can submit more than 15 names, but the team will be more inaccurate the more names you put down.
      If you simply want to create one large team, run the program, but submit an empty file for the varsity field 
    </p>
    <h3>Output</h3>
    <p>
      Output will be given as a CSV which you can copy and paste into excel or sheets.
      It is separated into two sections - the varsity output (which will be at the top)
      and the junior varsity output (which will be at the bottom)
